With large gatherings on the decline for this year, you can now treat yourself to some ethically made sweets with the extra money youâ€™ll be savingâ€¦ Our biggest recommendation as we kick off the holiday season is to avoid [Nestle](https://ethicli.com/info/nestle) products such as Butterfinger, Crunch, Laffy Taffy, Kit Kat, and Wonka. They are our lowest-scored brand at a 1.0, which Ethicli will break down.

# Nestle Rating Breakdown

* Responsible for mass deforestation to source cocoa and palm oil
* Destroys streams, aquifers and wildlife

Unfortunately, these points are only the beginning of how Nestle has taken advantage of communities and the planet. However now is a great time to take the #NestlePledge to not purchase any of their products yourself. Below is an infographic to show some of their other popular brands.

# So how can we avoid NestlÃ©?

Their company ethics may be concerning to say the least, but with so much extra time at home, itâ€™s a perfect time to try your hand at making some home-made sweets! How about these [Vegan Citrus Chocolate Truffles](https://sweetpotatosoul.com/2017/10/citrus-chocolate-truffles.html), or using your leftover pumpkin seeds to make this [Pumpkin Seed Brittle](https://www.chocolateforbasil.com/blog/pumpkin-seed-brittle?rq=candy)? You may be surprised how easy it can be to make sweets from home!

# Ethical Chocolate and Candy Alternatives

Oof, is the idea of DIY candy not your style? Then here are some alternatives with our ethical shopping partner [Uncommon Goods](http://uncommongoods.sjv.io/OXymP) that are sure to satisfy your sweet-tooth, and theyâ€™re so nice theyâ€™re even gift-able to a friend! Or, if you cannot find a locally-made bakery, candy maker or chocolatier, ethical options may be available at your local grocers. If youâ€™re shopping in person, look for these labels: Fair-Trade, Rainforest Alliance, RSPO Certified Sustainable Palm Oil, & Certified Organic to ensure that ethical steps are being taken to care for our workers, planet and animals involved in the process.
